            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Short State of the CASE Between the Phyſicians &amp; Surgeons, Relating to the <hi>Surgeons Bill, now before the Honourable</hi> Houſe <hi>of</hi> Commons.</head>
            <p n="1">I. THIS is now the third time that the Surgeons have preferred A Bill of the ſame Nature to the Parliament, which hath hitherto been rejected: As likewiſe their many Attempts to the ſame purpoſe, before the Right Honourable the Privy-Council, as by our Hiſtorical Account (to which we referr) at large appears.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Subſtance of what is deſired in their Bill, conſiſts chiefly in theſe Particulars. (1.) <hi>That they may have liberty to give Internal Medicines in all Chyrurgical Caſes,</hi> (that is indeed in all Caſes) for by pretence of Bliſtering, Cupping, Bleeding, applying Leeches, or the like, there is ſearce a Fever, or any other Diſeaſe, which they will not account a Chyrurgical Caſe. (2.) <hi>That they may be Conſulted with by Phyſicians in all Caſes whatſoever;</hi> which moſt plainly diſcovers the extent of their Deſign. (3.) <hi>That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and Licenſing of Surgeons to practiſe in the manner aforeſaid, may be in themſelves, as ſole Judges of the ſufficiency and abilities of their Members for that purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Reaſons they alledge for all this, are, (1.) <hi>That they have formerly had the like Powers.</hi> (2.) <hi>That theſe Powers are of abſolute neceſſity to fit them for the Kings Service.</hi> (3.) <hi>That the Phyſicians have 'till of late always Conſulted with them in Caſes where Internal Medicines were to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which it is briefly reply'd, That both by Acts of Parliament, and Orders of the Privy Council, we find the Surgeons have always been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to give Internal Medicines in any Chyrurgical, or other Caſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; to which the Opinions of the Judges have alſo Correſponded, and therefore their firſt Reaſon is a manifeſt untruth, as is the third alſo. The ſecond indeed has ſome ſeeming weight in it, ſince all due Care ought to be taken, that their Majeſties Fleets and Armies ſhould be furniſhed with Perſons fit and able for that Service, and Skilful in the Adminiſtring of Internal as well as External Remedies.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:152373:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>To this we anſwer, That the College of Phyſicians has been always ready to Licenſe ſuch Surgeons to practiſe in all Caſes, even where Internal Medicines are required, as have upon Examination approved themſelves fitly qualified ſo to do; of which there have been, and are at preſent many inſtances, as they themſelves well know. But ſince the College of Phyſicians was therefore Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, on purpoſe to take care that none but very able and already well Skilled Perſons ſhould Practiſe Phyſick in <hi>London,</hi> or within ſeven Miles thereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King, Queen, and Royal Family, the Nobility and chief Gentry uſually reſided, and Parliaments ordinarily met there: We humbly conceive it will not be thought reaſonable, only for the ſake of the Surgeons, to permit raw and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd perſons to pick up their Skill of giving Internal Medicines, by practiſing upon the Kings chief Subjects uſually reſiding within that compaſs, which is never granted, even to thoſe bred at the Univerſities; till by long ſtudy and experience in the Country, they have firſt ſo qualify'd themſelves as to paſs three ſolemn Examinations by the Preſident and Cenſors, before they can be Licenſed to the Practice of Phyſick within <hi>London,</hi> and ſeven Miles; ſo that, in fine, the only Diſpute between us is, Whether the Preſident and Cenſors of the College of Phyſicians, with whom the Law hath already intruſted the Examination and Licenſing of all Practiſers in Phyſick, or the Maſters and Wardens of the Barber-Surgeons (who never had any ſutable Education or Learning for it) ſhould by a new Law be made Judges of mens ſufficiency in a Profeſſion of which they themſelves are wholly Ignorant? which We humbly leave to the Judgment of this Honourable Houſe.</p>
            <p>And, whereas it is by them ſuggeſted, that the Phyſicians have always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd their Majeſties Service in their Navies and Armies, the contrary ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appears by the Annals of the College cited in our larger Hiſtorical Account, wherein we find that ſeveral Perſons, ſuch as Dr. <hi>Hawley,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hamey,</hi> Dr. <hi>Goddard,</hi> Dr. <hi>Dawſon,</hi> the Great Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> Sir <hi>Alexander Frazier,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Scarburgh,</hi> and our preſent Learned Preſident Dr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> with many others, have heretore, and lately ſerved the Crown both by Sea and Land; and there are now many very ready to undertake the ſame Employment. But on the other ſide, it is but too notorious, that the Surgeons of any Ability or Name in Town, do generally avoid ſerving in their own Perſons, and ſubſtitute their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices or others (who were not bred in this Town and for the moſt part live out of it) of little or no experience even in their own Trade, in their places; who are rather fit to try Practices upon the King's Seamen and Souldiers, than any way qualified for the Practice of Phyſick, or indeed of Chyrurgery it ſelf, as the Officers both by Sea and Land do generally complain; tho' theſe Perſons have been always firſt approved by ſuch as are the Surgeons uſual Examiners.</p>
            <p>So that it is apparent, that the Surgeons by this their Bill intend not the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, but their own private advantage, and much to be ſuſpected, when under the notion of giving Internal Medicines in Chyrurgical Caſes, they have drawn to themſelves the entire Practice of Phyſick, they will then be much more backward to ſerve at Sea and in the Armies than already they are to the yet greater prejudice of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the laſt place, We humbly ſubmit it to the Conſideration of this Honourable Houſe, what Prejudice it muſt needs be to both our Famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, if ſuch great numbers of Surgeons, and perhaps many meer Quacks, under that Name, ſhall be ſuffer'd to Invade one of the Learned Profeſſions, to the great diſcouragement of all Students therein.</hi>
